# Chip 8 Emulator

I wanted to learn about low-level programming while practicing my C++ skills, so I started researching online. I discovered that many people recommend starting with a Chip-8 emulator for those interested in building emulators. Its not that im into emulators that much but i saw this more as some sort off challenge 




## Lessons Learned

What did i learn while building this project? 
Well to be honest this project was one of the hardest projects i ever worked on so i learned alot but if i had one thing i would say learning about opcodes and how to decode and execute them was something that will stay in my mind for sure. 



## Screenshots
I just put this here since this is what helped me
